<p>Robius is a fully open-source, decentralized, community-driven effort to enable multi-platform application development in Rust.</p>
<p>The Robius organization also acts as an informal<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> working group: a welcoming, public space to collect and discuss resources related to improving and furthering the app dev experience in Rust.</p>

<h2 id="our-vision"><a class="header" href="#our-vision">Our vision</a></h2>
<p>We believe that the Rust programming language is the right choice for the next generation of application developers,
but that the language ecosystem needs a bit more love and attention to make it a first-class citizen in the world of application development, particularly on mobile platforms.</p>
<p>We envision a future in which:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rust developers can create safe, beautiful, and robust applications that execute efficiently and performantly on a wide variety of platforms, especially mobile.</li>
<li>Frontend developers using other languages are encouraged to come over to the <del>dark side</del> wonderful world of Rust and give it a try, with a seamless transition experience that helps overcome the steep learning curve commonly associated with Rust.</li>
<li>The Rust ecosystem is broadened and strengthened, demonstrating to existing Rust experts in other domains that Rust is a great fit for application development, not just low-level systems and embedded programming.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="whats-in-a-name"><a class="header" href="#whats-in-a-name">What's in a name?</a></h3>
<p>The name <em>Robius</em> comes from the Latin word <a href="http://latin-dictionary.net/definition/33662/robius-robia-robium">robius</a>, meaning red in color, as in oxen, wheat, rust, etc.
This makes for a nice color-based connection to Rust, our programming language of choice.</p>
<p>Robius rhymes with Mobius, and our logo/icons take inspiration from the wordplay combination of &quot;Rust&quot; and &quot;Mobius strip&quot;. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, <em>technically</em>, the original German name is Möbius, but we use an Americanized pronunciation with a long &quot;o&quot; sound: &quot;Roe-bee-us&quot; / ˈɹoʊˈbiəs.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="key-community-projects"><a class="header" href="#key-community-projects">Key Community Projects</a></h2>
<p>The Robius ecosystem consists of several independent projects that can be composed into a complete system stack to realize fast, painless application development across multiple platforms in pure Rust.
Components are loosely coupled, allowing a developer (in the future) to customize which components are used to comprise the underlying system, such as choosing </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://makepad.nl/">Makepad</a> is a cross-platform UI toolkit currently under active development that offers a hybrid retained-mode and immediate-mode UI model.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rapid development cycle: <em>very</em> fast compile times due to a custom minimal dependency set, plus a custom DSL for live design that enables hot reloading of UI elements.</li>
<li>Makepad Studio: an IDE prototype built using Makepad itself with unique features like cross-process shared textures for live reload of an in-window UI app, docking tabs for file/window views, hyper-smooth code folding, and more.</li>
<li>Makepad framework: a (growing) collection of highly-performant widgets and minimal, zero/low-overhead platform abstractions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://dioxuslabs.com/">Dioxus</a> is a cross-platform, production-ready UI toolkit that is inspired by React, with a custom metalanguage called RSX that is used to declare UI elements/layout in an HTML-like style.</p>
<ul>
<li>Supports <em>many</em> platforms with a set of interchangeable target renderers, including desktop, webapps, static sites, text UIs, liveview, and mobile.</li>
<li>Fast and memory-efficient, with perfect lighthouse scores and performance orders of magnitude better than Node or Python.</li>
<li>Excellent built-in abstractions for state management.</li>
<li>Easy, familiar styling using vanilla CSS or the CSS framework of your choice, e.g., Tailwind.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/osiris-apis">Osiris</a> is a set of Rust interfaces for developing immersive applications atop a diverse set of operating systems services and platform-specific functionality.</p>
<ul>
<li>Osiris aims to provide Rust apps with an easy canonical way to access platform features like storage, networking, multimedia (video, audio, camera), geolocation, device orientation (accelerometer, gyro), timers &amp; alarms, notifications, clipboard, drag-n-drop, and more. </li>
<li><code>osi</code>: the primary Rust package that exposes direct access to OS interfaces. Higher-level Rust abstractions are coming soon, after raw interfaces for more platforms are complete.</li>
<li>Osiris offers build tooling that can:
<ol>
<li>Set up new project directories with auto-generated scaffolding for platform-specific integration components that can be customized post-creation.</li>
<li>Generate application artifacts that adhere to the policies of each platform, i.e., packages that can be published to common app stores (Google Play, Apple App Store, Microsoft Store, etc).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gitee.com/openharmony/commonlibrary_rust_ylong_runtime">ylong</a> is an async runtime for Rust that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Priority</em>-based scheduling of tasks.</li>
<li>Abstractions for auto-parallelizing computation, offering parallel iterators over data in a manner similar to <a href="https://crates.io/crates/rayon">rayon</a>, but for <em>async tasks</em> rather than native (OS-level) threads.</li>
<li>Standard primitives for non-blocking async I/O, async synchronization, and async timers.</li>
<li>An executor and reactor to schedule tasks and respond to system events, respectively.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="repositories-of-interest"><a class="header" href="#repositories-of-interest">Repositories of Interest</a></h2>
<p>Robius aims to provide a fully-functional <em>reference design</em> of the entire system stack beneath the application, for which an architectural overview and detailed documentation will be available.</p>
<p>We also intend to provide two classes of actual applications:</p>
<ol>
<li>Flagships: complete, fully-featured apps with a clean UI design, polished UX, and functional business logic. These apps will be publishable to platform app stores.</li>
<li>Simple demos: a series of basic example apps that exhibit a few key features, with mock components underneath and elsewhere.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="flagship-apps"><a class="header" href="#flagship-apps">Flagship apps</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Robrix: the Robius Matrix chat client.  Coming soon!
<ul>
<li>The needs of this app will be the primary driver for Robius development.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Robius is a brand new vision -- we're just getting off the ground.</p>
<p>Currently, the best way to get started is to directly use one of the <a href="status.html#key-community-members">recommended UI toolkits</a> to build out your application's UI and define its UX behavior.
For now, everything else beyond UI will require you to add the missing pieces yourself, e.g., network connectivity, async multitasking, and access to other device peripherals or system services. </p>
<p>Everything is developed right here in the open, so check back for updates often!
We plan to introduce a pre-alpha version of the full Robius system stack (everything beneath the application) by early-to-mid 2024, which will enable easier access to and integration of other platform/OS features alongside the UI toolkits.</p>

<p>The Robius project's primary focus is to provide a multi-platform application development toolkit where both the app and the entire system stack are written completely in Rust.
This will enable developers across all layers to leverage the many benefits of Rust: safety, efficiency, fearless concurrency, high performance, and a robust ecosystem of crates spanning many domains.
A Rust-only stack avoids the additional complexity brought on by introducing other languages via FFI interop layers; these &quot;bridges&quot; only facilitate the usage of Rust for business logic, and impose high overhead when crossing the boundary between Rust and the platform-native framework.</p>
<p>Robius's secondary focus is to make the Rust experience on mobile platforms feel like a first-class citizen.
Historically, Rust on mobile has been a neglected area of the ecosystem, missing key components from build tooling to native-like UIs and widgets to platform support crates.
We want to make Rust as enjoyable to use on mobile platforms as it is to use in systems programming environments.</p>
<p>Robius is and always will be fully open-source, decentralized, and community-driven.</p>
<h2 id="whats-in-a-name-1"><a class="header" href="#whats-in-a-name-1">What's in a name?</a></h2>
<p>The name <em>Robius</em> comes from the Latin word <a href="http://latin-dictionary.net/definition/33662/robius-robia-robium">robius</a>, meaning red in color, as in oxen, wheat, rust, etc.
This makes for a nice color-based connection to Rust, our programming language of choice.</p>
<p>Robius rhymes with Mobius, and our logo/icons take inspiration from the wordplay combination of &quot;Rust&quot; and &quot;Mobius strip&quot;. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, <em>technically</em>, the original German name is Möbius, but we use an Americanized pronunciation with a long &quot;o&quot; sound: &quot;Roe-bee-us&quot; / ˈɹoʊˈbiəs.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cspell:ignore Mobius, Möbius, ˈɹoʊˈbiəs -->
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="motivation-why-robius"><a class="header" href="#motivation-why-robius">Motivation: why Robius?</a></h1>
<p>Several motivating factors inspired us to start the Robius project:</p>
<ol>
<li>App developers want to use Rust, but aren’t sure where or how to get started due to Rust's app dev ecosystem being in a rough state. 
<ul>
<li>Paralysis of choice among dozens of partial solutions</li>
<li>Unclear how to integrate many disparate projects</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<ol start="2">
<li>There are clear <strong>business advantages</strong> to writing applications in a multi-platform Rust framework.
<ul>
<li>Provide a consistent experience for devs and customers</li>
<li>Avoid redundant dev effort → save money, faster time to market</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Rust is a great language and the right choice for many programming domains, but not for multi-platform apps ... <em>yet</em>.
<ul>
<li>Safety → increased correctness, reliability, lower debugging costs</li>
<li>High performance → responsive, jank-free UI</li>
<li>No runtime or garbage collection → energy efficiency on mobile devices</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>The following sections examine each of these factors in detail.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="1-developers-really-want-to-write-apps-in-rust"><a class="header" href="#1-developers-really-want-to-write-apps-in-rust">1. Developers <em>really</em> want to write apps in Rust</a></h2>
<!-- ## 1. Developers express great interest in writing Rust apps -->
<p>Online programming forums are filled with posts asking how to use Rust to develop mobile, desktop, and web applications. 
We have observed this trend for several years in two main flavors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Existing Rust systems-level developers that wonder if they can leverage their Rust knowledge for applications too.</li>
<li>Frontend app developers that currently use other languages, but want to use Rust because they have heard about its benefits. </li>
</ul>
<p>The former group of Rust devs is mainly focused on the biggest unknown to them: creating GUI apps and packaging apps up for mobile targets; this is the first group that we wish to support with Robius.
The latter group of frontend devs have deeper expertise in application-level implementation but are not sure how to transition those skills to the world of Rust; this is the second group that we wish to support.
One major commonality is that both groups are unsure how or where to start developing an app in Rust.</p>
<h3 id="ecosystem-is-fractured-and-incomplete"><a class="header" href="#ecosystem-is-fractured-and-incomplete">Ecosystem is fractured and incomplete</a></h3>
<p>The first problem that most aspiring devs encounter is the massive collection of projects, mostly GUI libraries, many of which are incomplete proofs-of-concept or simply abandoned.
Though there are many competing UI frameworks in the main <code>crates.io</code> registry, it is difficult to discover which ones are most appropriate for a given application's needs, and even harder to determine whether and how these projects can be integrated with others to form a functional app dev toolkit.</p>
<p>For more evidence, look no further than the <a href="https://areweguiyet.com/"><code>areweguiyet.org</code></a> website, which aims to track the bevy of GUI crates and their progress. Their homepage states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a low level language, Rust is perfectly suitable for making user interfaces the old fashioned way, with native APIs. However, competing in today's world typically means supporting many platforms, and that makes using native APIs an unattractive option for many.</p>
<p>Rust's expressiveness and high level abstractions make it ideal for building intricate and complex user interfaces. Unfortunately, there is little consensus on what the best abstractions are.</p>
<p>There are a number of bindings available today to existing frameworks, but those looking for a mature, easy to use, and completely Rust-based solution will most likely find themselves out of luck.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Due to the relatively young age of the Rust language itself, many of these crates are incomplete, as building a UI toolkit is a lengthy endeavor.
Most are only proofs-of-concept that offer barebones UI primitives; 
even the more mature and fully-developed crates only offer a partial solution for application development, focusing primarily on the UI appearance and fundamental UX behavior. </p>
<p>As expected, there is not yet a de facto &quot;best&quot; toolkit, nor has the Rust Foundation or Rust project teams made any official recommendation or guidebook concerning this matter.
Although this is good for the sake of both neutrality and healthy competition, it has led to a fractured ecosystem in which nearly every crate has significant overlap with the functionality of several other crates.
This overlap makes it even harder to select a UI toolkit for a new app, as the differences between toolkits are minimal on paper and only become evident after several weeks of development experience with each one.</p>
<p>All in all, there is a noticeable absence of cohesion and coordination in this ecosystem, presenting the most significant barrier of entry to cross-platform application development in Rust.
This is especially evident when compared to app dev frameworks led by a single directing entity, such as React Native or Flutter. </p>
<h3 id="apps-need-more-than-just-ui--ux"><a class="header" href="#apps-need-more-than-just-ui--ux">Apps need more than just UI + UX</a></h3>
<p>Even if GUI development in Rust was a solved problem, UIs do not tell the whole story — an application still needs to access services and features from the underlying platform or OS.
As with UI works, there are indeed a plethora of crates that offer basic interfaces to access platform-specific features.
Some offer general abstractions of a single feature across multiple platforms, while others or specific features on a single platform.</p>
<p>These features are crucial to developing <em>immersive</em> applications that take full advantage of the software and hardware functionality afforded to them by the device platform.
For example, robust applications typically expect an app dev framework to expose the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>camera, multimedia (audio and video) capture and playback, </li>
<li>geolocation, haptic feedback actuators like vibration motors,</li>
<li>system services like notifications, drag and drop, a rich clipboard,</li>
<li>on-device sensors like accelerometers/gyros, barometers, thermometers, proximity and ambient light sensors, etc,</li>
<li>local communication protocols like WiFi, Bluetooth, NFC, and more,</li>
<li>typical I/O like storage, cache space, and networking, in a platform-native manner.</li>
</ul>
<p>While these crates can certainly be used directly by an application, this model places the serious burden of assembling multiple piecemeal crates into a workable platform abstraction on the shoulders of the application developers themselves.
This expectation is not feasible for most application developers, as they are neither sufficiently experienced nor have the time to undertake such an arduous task.</p>
<p>That is why we created the <a href="https://github.com/osiris-apis/osi"><strong>Osiris project</strong></a> — to fill in the gaps and offer a fully-integrated, consistent solution for accessing platform-specific functionality in an abstract manner.</p>
<h3 id="documentation-is-paramount"><a class="header" href="#documentation-is-paramount">Documentation is paramount</a></h3>
<p>Another reason many newcomers find it so difficult to get started is that there is a distinct lack of documentation, tutorials, and examples for the vast majority of crates in this domain.</p>
<p>If examples exist, they are extraordinarily simple and only cover the basics of setting up a primitive UI or application skeleton.
Holistic tutorials and complete examples are few and hard to come by, which exacerbates the integration problem. 
Without end-to-end sample code, it is challenging for an expert, let alone a newcomer to the worlds of app dev and Rust, to compose a working system stack by integrating multiple disparate crates together. </p>
<p>One guiding light in this space is Dioxus, which has <a href="https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.4/reference">recently released high-quality comprehensive documentation</a> for both external users and internal contributors along with several well-commented demo apps, making it both easy and enticing to use Dioxus to create new apps.</p>
<p>For a Rust application development framework to gain real traction, it must lead the pack in terms of documentation quality, tutorial thoroughness, and variety and depth of real-world example application code.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="2-rust-app-dev-offers-clear-business-advantages"><a class="header" href="#2-rust-app-dev-offers-clear-business-advantages">2. Rust app dev offers clear business advantages</a></h2>
<p>There is a strong business case to be made for application development in Rust.
Several existing commercial applications have already been &quot;written in Rust,&quot; but Rust is only used to implement an internal business logic layer; the entire remainder of the app (e.g., frontend UI and UX) is written using different platform-specific native languages and SDKs.
This leads to significant fragmentation and redundant development effort on each platform they wish to support, i.e., wasted expense.</p>
<p>One such example is <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a>, a popular open-source messaging app focused on user privacy. 
As pictured below, Signal maintains multiple separate repositories for each of its client apps on <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android">Android</a>, <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-iOS">iOS</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Desktop">desktop</a>, as well as for its <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Server">server</a>.
The Rust component of Signal is the shared <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal"><code>libsignal</code> crate</a>, which implements the main Signal protocol functionality in a platform-agnostic manner with multiple bindings to other platform-native languages like Swift, Typescript, and Java.</p>
<p><img src="whitepaper/motivation/../img/signal.png" alt="Signal app architecture" /></p>
<p>Each of these app repositories are non-trivial in size: 450K+ LoC on iOS, 350K+ LoC on Android, and 250K+ LoC on desktop.
The only reason the Signal desktop app is not even more complex and large is because it is built atop the <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a> framework, which is known to be an <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Desktop/issues/2178#issuecomment-378233583">inefficient resource hog</a> with <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Desktop/issues/2178#issuecomment-384911415">poor accessibility</a> support.
However, building desktop apps on Electron is still the default choice because it is easy and familiar, and at the time there were no viable alternatives to <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Desktop/issues/2178#issuecomment-376466372">the much more expensive option</a> of per-platform native apps on Windows, macOS, and Linux. </p>
<p>The main disadvantage of having multiple separate app repos is that it is incredibly challenging maintain consistency in both appearance and behavior.
General maintainability also becomes more tedious, as bugs that manifest differently across platforms must be addressed on an individual basis.
To their credit, Signal has actually done an impressive job of just that, with help from the community, though naturally some minor issues do slip through the cracks.
For example, Signal on Android allows placing secure chats behind a screen lock (e.g., using biometrics), but desktop Signal does not offer that.
Signal on Android cannot search only a single chat only, while other platforms support that filter.
Mobile Signal apps offer contact-specific notifications, while desktop does not.
The iOS app does not allow choice of fonts or changing font sizes and has different defaults than others, e.g., for embedded link previews, WiFi vs. cellular data usage, etc.</p>
<hr />
<p>Another similar motivating example is <a href="https://element.io/">Element</a>, a first-party <a href="https://element.io/matrix-benefits">Matrix chat</a> client that is also implemented separately on each platform, including <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-android">Android</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-ios">iOS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-desktop">desktop</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-web">web</a>.
Unfortunately, the maintenance burden has proven difficult to handle, with Element apps receiving moderately poor user reviews (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=im.vector.app">3.8⭐ on Google Play</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/element-messenger/id1083446067">3.5⭐ on Apple's App Store</a>) due to inconsistent behavior, bugs, and slow performance.
This undoubtedly stems from the effort required to accommodate the idiosyncrasies of each platform, which steals developer focus away from improving the main app-level features and experience.</p>
<p>Element themselves have acknowledged this issue and began developing a new set of applications called Element X, with a focus on sharing code across platforms via a shared <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk">Matrix Rust SDK</a>.
They are also exploring a new design system called <a href="https://compound.element.io/">Compound</a> that aims to establish consistent UI component implementations shared across iOS, Android, and the web.
However, both <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/compound#related-projects">Compound</a> and Element X apps on <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-android">Android</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios">iOS</a> still exist separately and are implemented with platform-specific UI frameworks, e.g., Jetpack Compose and SwiftUI.</p>
<!-- cspell:ignore Jetpack -->
<p>Element claims that the Element X apps are <a href="https://element.io/blog/element-x-experience-the-future-of-element/">up to 6000 times faster</a> than the legacy Element apps, due in part to Rust:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our new Rust SDK makes development faster and more consistent across the Android and iOS apps, while providing a super-speedy and high quality implementation thanks to Rust’s legendary language safety features. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although the new sliding sync protocol is likely responsible for the majority of those performance gains, this statement speaks to the <strong>attitude surrounding Rust</strong> — that switching to Rust will bring 💪 huge gains 💪.</p>
<p>In general, a business stands to gain several competitive advantages from using a cross-platform Rust app dev toolkit, as listed below. These mostly overlap with the benefits of switching to Flutter<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>, though <a href="whitepaper/motivation/business_cases.html#rust-is-increasingly-popular-admired-and-wanted">as shown later</a>, developers vastly prefer using Rust over Dart, Flutter's required language.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to deliver a more consistent experience to customers across platforms.</li>
<li>Ease of attracting talented developers due to a modern stack and better team culture/morale<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.</li>
<li>Elimination of redundant development effort across platforms, which: 
<ul>
<li>Saves money due to higher productivity, </li>
<li>Results in a faster time to market, and</li>
<li>Allows developers to focus more on UI/UX quality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, these favorable Rust experiences, together with the challenges faced by Signal and Element with maintaining separate per-platform app repositories, clearly motivate the need for a multi-platform application development toolkit in Rust.</p>

<p>Both current trends and key aspects of Rust reinforce our assertion that Rust is the best choice for the next generation of multi-platform application development.</p>
<h3 id="rust-is-increasingly-popular-admired-and-wanted"><a class="header" href="#rust-is-increasingly-popular-admired-and-wanted">Rust is increasingly popular, admired, and wanted</a></h3>
<p>Rust has been voted the most admired language for the past 8 years in a row (2015 - 2023), according to the <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/">StackOverflow annual developer survey</a>.
For the first time, Rust also became the most wanted language this year (2023).</p>

</p>
<p>In addition, Rust is leading the development of technologies for new platforms, e.g., it is the <a href="https://blog.scottlogic.com/2023/10/18/the-state-of-webassembly-2023.html">most frequently used language for WebAssembly (WASM)</a> for the third year running.

The same study also found that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developers of WASM tools have a strong preference for Rust,</li>
<li>Rust is the most <em>desired</em> language for projects involving WASM, and</li>
<li>The leading and most-used WASM runtimes are written in Rust, the <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime"><code>Wasmtime</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer"><code>wasmer</code></a> projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>These trends indicate that Rust adoption will continue to grow, and that other developers are open and willing to learn Rust in order to use it for new applications.</p>
<h3 id="rust-combines-safety-with-usability-and-performance"><a class="header" href="#rust-combines-safety-with-usability-and-performance">Rust combines safety with usability and performance</a></h3>
<p>If you're reading this book, you likely already know about the strengths of Rust and the benefits that it provides.
If not, we cover a select subset of those benefits here.</p>
<p>First, Rust's strong, static type system guards against type errors at compile time, enabling full type safety.
This type safety leads to memory safety, which eliminates entire classes of bugs: use after free, double free, buffer overflow and underflow, reading uninitialized memory, concurrency violations like race conditions, and more.</p>
<p>Rust's memory safety is also statically determinable due to its type-based <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/ownership.html">ownership model</a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html">borrow checker</a>, which operate at compile-time.
This allows Rust programs to execute efficiently without an underlying runtime or a garbage collector, as memory safety and resource management operations (like cleanup routines that invoke destructors) are deterministically inserted <em>by the compiler</em> when a resource is released by its owner (e.g., falls out of scope).</p>
<p>Another aspect of Rust that contributes to its high performance is its focus on zero-cost abstractions, in which libraries expose higher-level, easier-to-use programming interfaces that still compile down to the equivalent of manually-optimized machine code.</p>
<p>Some concrete examples of great Rust features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Default <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html#variables-and-mutability">immutability</a> of variables, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html#shadowing">scoped bindings and shadowing</a>, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-05-control-flow.html#loop-labels-to-disambiguate-between-multiple-loops">loops with labels</a>, and more.</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-00-structs.html">Struct definitions</a> with <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-02-defining-modules-to-control-scope-and-privacy.html">flexible naming visibility</a>, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-01-defining-structs.html#unit-like-structs-without-any-fields">newtype wrapper patterns</a>, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#the-tuple-type">heterogeneous tuples</a>, etc.</li>
<li>Excellent sum types (<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-00-enums.html"><code>enum</code>s</a>) with contained values, which, along with very ergonomic <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-02-match.html">pattern matching</a>, provides <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html">excellent error handling</a> using types like <code>Option</code> and <code>Result</code>.</li>
<li>Support for <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-00-generics.html">generic type parameters</a> for types (structs), functions, associated trait items, and even <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-03-lifetime-syntax.html">explicit lifetimes</a> for borrowed values.</li>
<li>Abstraction of interfaces using <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-02-traits.html">traits</a>, which can bound generic type parameters and even be used to imitate OOP-like polymorphism.</li>
<li>Const evaluation of expressions at compile time.</li>
<li><code>async</code> functions and traits, which the compiler transforms into state machines.</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch13-00-functional-features.html">Functional programming language features</a> like iterators, closures with value capturing, combinators, and more.</li>
<li>Both hygienic <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-06-macros.html#declarative-macros-with-macro_rules-for-general-metaprogramming">declarative macros</a> as well as <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-06-macros.html#procedural-macros-for-generating-code-from-attributes">procedural macros</a> for expressive meta-programming.</li>
</ul>
<p>Static type and memory safety enable Rust to catch many classes of bugs at <em>compile-time</em>, which reduces developer frustration, minimizes debugging difficulties, and provides a higher degree of confidence that a program will run correctly and reliably after deployment.
Early error detection combined with <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/learn">Rust's excellent documentation</a>, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">tutorial books</a>, IDE <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/">language server plugins like <code>rust-analyzer</code></a>, detailed compiler error messages enable developers to be much more productive than other languages.</p>
<p>In addition, Rust's safety model can restrict possible root causes of bugs to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-01-unsafe-rust.html"><code>unsafe</code> code</a> regions, though not for basic logic bugs. 
Rust is also amenable to <a href="https://rust-formal-methods.github.io/tools.html">formal verification</a>, both in terms of verifying soundness of unsafe code blocks, correctness of unsafe-safe code boundaries, and correctness of type-carried invariants.</p>
<p>While most Rust features and benefits apply to all platforms and execution environments, certain ones are key for mobile platforms.
High performance is particularly important in interactive systems like mobile devices, in order to provide a smooth, responsive UI/UX without jank.
Similarly, efficient operation is crucial to extend usable life in battery-powered devices and reduce thermal output in body-proximal hardware without active cooling.</p>
<h3 id="rusts-core-ecosystem-is-excellent"><a class="header" href="#rusts-core-ecosystem-is-excellent">Rust's core ecosystem is excellent</a></h3>
<p>Finally, Rust comes with an excellent suite of features and tooling beyond the core language itself.
First, Rust's primary compiler <code>rustc</code> <a href="https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/overview.html#code-generation">uses LLVM as a backend</a>, which affords it two main benefits: </p>
<ol>
<li>Rust can leverage LLVM's existing support for <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/targets/index.html">a wide set of target triples</a>, including many architectures, target OS platforms, and library environments.
<ul>
<li>Most importantly, the compiler supports cross-compiling by default, making it super easy to build code for a different target than your host. To state the obvious, quick and easy cross-compilation is a <strong>key prerequisite</strong> for a multi-platform app dev framework.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Despite being a relatively young language, Rust can immediately realize highly-optimized code generation thanks to decades of effort poured into LLVM by compiler experts.</li>
</ol>
<p>Second, Rust's package manager <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/"><code>cargo</code></a> vastly simplifies discovering, specifying, and correctly building dependencies for your project.
It integrates tightly with <a href="https://crates.io/"><code>crates.io</code></a>, a registry of crates (projects) from the Rust community that makes it trivial to publish, distribute, and depend on other open-source crates.
Furthermore, cargo makes it easy to specify dependencies as an exact version or a range of versions of a given crates by utilizing <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/resolver.html#semver-compatibility">SemVer</a> semantic versioning.
This design avoids the versioning hell that frequently plagues other languages and package manager, and there are even <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-semverver">community-provided tools</a> to ensure semver compliance when releasing new versions of a crate.</p>
<p>Third, the set of packages available in the Rust world is <em>far</em> larger in both number and scope than that of Flutter, the leading cross-platform app dev framework.
Rust's <code>crates.io</code> registry includes around 130,000 packages, while Flutter's registry of Dart packages <a href="https://pub.dev/"><code>pub.dev</code></a> is only about one quarter of that.
More importantly, the <a href="https://crates.io/categories">breadth of domains</a> covered by the Rust crate ecosystem is massive, including topics like compression, cryptography, finance, game engines, mathematics, multimedia, parsing, scientific computing, text editing/processing, and more. 
This allows a Rust app developer to immediately and easily bring in a ready-to-use set of dependencies across a wide berth of app topics, which more likely covers unique, niche app use cases.
In comparison, the Dart package registry is primarily concerned with basic app topics, e.g., UI widgets and UX behavior.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="rust-does-have-some-relevant-shortcomings"><a class="header" href="#rust-does-have-some-relevant-shortcomings">Rust does have some relevant shortcomings</a></h2>
<p>While Rust offers an excellent experience for systems development, it does have some disadvantages from a UI standpoint, many of which represent obstacles for its usage in application development.</p>
<h3 id="1-lack-of-inheritance"><a class="header" href="#1-lack-of-inheritance">1. Lack of inheritance</a></h3>
<p>First, Rust doesn't support true type-level inheritance, only interface-level inheritance (at the trait level).
This makes it difficult to realize the object-oriented programming design patterns to which UI developers are typically accustomed, e.g., a base displayable/widget class from which other subclasses can inherit and override functionality as necessary.</p>
<h3 id="2-representing-shared-mutable-state-is-hard"><a class="header" href="#2-representing-shared-mutable-state-is-hard">2. Representing shared mutable state is hard</a></h3>
<p>Second, it can be difficult to implement access to shared mutable state in Rust.
The ownership and borrow-checking semantics are not yet sophisticated enough to support all use cases and programming patterns typically found in UI development and state management frameworks, e.g., updating a state from a background thread that is then read by the main UI thread to re-display it on a widget.
This is because Rust strictly enforces an &quot;aliasing XOR mutability&quot; rule for memory safety, meaning that there cannot be multiple simultaneous mutable aliases to a piece of shared state — only one mutable alias <em>or</em> multiple immutable aliases, but not both.</p>
<p>For example, a global static variable can be freely aliased multiple times, but only accessed <em>mutably</em> through unsafe code, which is undesirable, or via a wrapper type that offers interior mutability with some sort of mutual exclusion mechanism, e.g., a <code>Mutex</code>.
Even for states shared across different parts of a single thread, e.g., among async tasks, mutability still must be separated from aliasing, which is typically realized via the <code>RefCell</code> wrapper type (a single-threaded <code>Mutex</code> equivalent). 
Also, as Rust lacks runtime garbage collection, the de facto alternative is to wrap states with reference-counter pointer type, e.g., <code>Rc</code> or <code>Arc</code>, for easy sharing of states whose lifetimes are only determinable at runtime.
The result of these rules and conventions is that code becomes less ergonomic and readable, as it must be littered with <code>Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;State&gt;&gt;</code> or <code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;State&gt;&gt;</code> patterns rather than just direct access to <code>State</code>.</p>
<h3 id="3-slow-compilation"><a class="header" href="#3-slow-compilation">3. Slow compilation</a></h3>
<p>Third, the Rust compiler has a reputation for being &quot;slow&quot; in that compile times for large Rust projects can be high, at least compared to other languages.
This is primarily due to the need for and the ability of Rust to perform more safety checks at compile time than other languages.
The problem with slow compilation is that it lengthens the iterative development cycle, making it more tedious to test a quick change and reducing the overall productivity of app developers.
The good news is that compilation times are continuously improving thanks to the efforts of <a href="https://nnethercote.github.io/">Nick Nethercote and others</a>, but this still may pose a problem to Rust frameworks that wish to incorporate many features into a project build.</p>
<h3 id="4-steep-learning-curve"><a class="header" href="#4-steep-learning-curve">4. Steep learning curve</a></h3>
<p>Finally, Rust is known to have a steep learning curve, as the aforementioned rules for memory safety often present a barrier to newcomers, colloquially referred to as <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=rust+fighting+the+borrow+checker">&quot;fighting the borrow checker&quot;</a>.
While systems programmers and low-level programmers may already possess a deeper understanding of memory models and memory safety restrictions, frontend developers are less likely to be intimately familiar with these topics, as they are accustomed to working in higher-level languages that abstract away and handle memory management implicitly.
A survey from Very Good Ventures found that <a href="https://verygood.ventures/whitepaper/business-value-of-flutter">frontend developers needed around 3.5 months of retraining</a> to switch from a platform-native framework to the cross-platform Flutter framework before they could be equally productive.
It is possible that switching frontend developers to a Rust-based multi-platform framework like Robius could impose an even steeper barrier to entry.
As framework designers, we must be careful to strike a balance between explicitness, expressiveness, and simplicity in order to not get in the way of app developers' intentions and productivity.</p>
<!-- cspell:ignore Nethercote -->
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="project-goals"><a class="header" href="#project-goals">Project Goals</a></h1>
<p>The Robius project has set forth the following goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish a Rust app dev community and drive ecosystem development</li>
<li>Create reference design of full app + system stack</li>
<li>Develop flagship apps and simpler demo apps as proofs of concept</li>
<li><span style="color: gray;"> [Future] Give feedback to Rust's lang, libs, and cargo teams </span></li>
</ul>
<p>The following sections provide more details on each of these goals.
All in all, we hope that Robius will attract front-end developers to the world of Rust and encourage existing Rust experts to broaden their horizons and explore the application development domain as well.</p>
<h2 id="community-and-ecosystem"><a class="header" href="#community-and-ecosystem">Community and ecosystem</a></h2>
<p>Our goal is to establish the Robius project as a collective, communal space for all things related to multi-platform app development in Rust.
As this community doesn't yet exist, we are building it from the ground up.
Thus far, we have the <a href="https://github.com/project-robius/"><code>project-robius</code> GitHub organization</a> that aims to serve as a starting point, but once the vision has had more time to incubate and grow, we will create a working group related to app dev in Rust.
We also intend to host and maintain an &quot;are we app yet&quot; website that tracks the status and progress of our Rust app dev work in a public and easy-to-follow format.</p>
<p>As part of building this community, we aim to collect and maintain a set of crates related to app dev that are highly functional and actively supported.
In short, this amounts to identifying key projects in the space and inviting their authors, maintainers, and contributors to participate in the larger Robius vision.
Thus far, we have welcomed two major UI frameworks, Makepad and Dioxus, and a platform abstraction framework, Osiris, into the community.
We aim to foster collaboration between these founding projects in order to enable each project to jointly benefit from contributions and improvements to other projects.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are interested in adding your project or suggesting another project to add to Robius, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.
We're always looking for more projects to include in the Robius ecosystem!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another major goal of the Robius vision is to drive the <em>non-code</em> components of the ecosystem forward, i.e., documentation.
This whitepaper is one example, but we also strive to publish and support holistic (cross-project) docs and detailed tutorials, as well as provide a platform for blogs and discussion forums related to Rust app development.</p>
<h2 id="reference-design-for-full-system-stack"><a class="header" href="#reference-design-for-full-system-stack">Reference design for full-system stack</a></h2>
<p>The central goal of the Robius project is to deliver a complete working solution for multi-platform app development, in which all components in both the application and the systems stack are written in Rust.</p>
<p>We call this a &quot;reference design&quot; because it embodies only <em>one</em> incarnation of how the ecosystem of loosely-coupled components can be assembled into a fully-working stack.
The intent is for the reference design to act as a &quot;blessed&quot; systems stack that new developers can use to quickly and easily start building apps, i.e., a pre-integrated combination of components that are known to work well together.
At the same time, we wish to allow expert developers to tailor the stack to meet their more complex needs, e.g., by selecting or building different components to replace individual pieces of the stack.</p>
<p>The goal of the Robius reference design is to support all major platforms and OS environments, with mobile and desktop being the priority targets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile: Android, iOS</li>
<li>Desktop: Linux, macOS, Windows</li>
<li>Other: OpenHarmony</li>
<li>Web (plus WebAssembly) </li>
</ul>
<p>The following diagram shows the proposed architecture of this reference design, which is described in greater detail in the system architecture section of this whitepaper.</p>
<p><img src="whitepaper/img/reference_design.png" alt="Robius Reference Design" /></p>
<h2 id="flagship-apps-and-examples"><a class="header" href="#flagship-apps-and-examples">Flagship apps and examples</a></h2>
<p>In addition to the systems stack reference design, our other important deliverable goal is a series of open-source applications, in two broad categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Flagships apps
<ul>
<li>Full set of features with robust UI &amp; UX</li>
<li>Intended for actual usage/dogfooding</li>
<li>Commercial quality; publishable to app stores</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Example/demo apps
<ul>
<li>Simple structure intended to demonstrate a single feature</li>
<li>Minimal, incomplete UI &amp; UX</li>
<li>Missing features represented by mock stub implementations, e.g., simulated server/database backends</li>
<li>Can be used for automated testing/benchmarking</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We will strive for both flagship and example applications to be designed clearly, well-structured, thoroughly commented, and accompanied by documentation like a tutorial-style walkthrough.
The overarching goal is for these apps to be easily forked and modified by new developers, such that they can use these apps as templates for a quick start.</p>
<p>Our primary flagship application will be a Matrix chat client, tentatively called Robrix (Robius + Matrix).
The rationale behind this decision is manyfold:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Matrix protocol, like Robius, is open-source, free, and decentralized.</li>
<li>A chat client's features depend on a wide set of functionality from the underlying system, which will help steer and prioritize development of Osiris and its integration with UI toolkits like Makepad.</li>
<li>A chat client consists of multiple different UI views, which will drive development of a robust widget library and an expanded set of UI toolkit features.</li>
<li>It requires complex app/business logic like user authentication and account management, sending, receiving, and synchronizing messages, handling persistent state (caching, settings), delivering notifications, accessing local storage, etc.</li>
<li>Demanding features can be optionally added to stress test our system abstractions, e.g., audio/video chat, multimedia capture and playback, image display, etc.</li>
<li>Several Matrix chat clients already exist, which comprise a good basis for comparison between the Robius framework and the frameworks used to implement those clients. We can evaluated both the qualitative development experience and resulting application behavior of Robrix as well as its quantitative performance, relative to that of the other chat clients.</li>
</ul>
<p>The below diagram shows a tentative overview of the architecture of Robrix, including the components needed to realize its full set of features. We note that while this a multi-year endeavor, we hope to have a basic MVP available by mid-2024.</p>
<p><img src="whitepaper/img/robrix_architecture.png" alt="Robrix Matrix Chat Client Proposed Architecture" /></p>
<p>For the example applications, some initial ideas are listed below, several of which are already in progress.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple to-do or notes app</li>
<li>Social media news feed, e.g., Twitter, Facebook</li>
<li>Social video sharing apps, e.g., TikTok, YouTube shorts</li>
<li>Shopping/e-store app, e.g., Taobao, eBay, Amazon, Etsy</li>
<li>Basic drawing/sketch app, e.g., paint</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="advertise-business-value-of-robius"><a class="header" href="#advertise-business-value-of-robius">Advertise business value of Robius</a></h2>
<p>In the long term, our ultimate goal is drive the development of Robius into a robust, stable ecosystem that inherently demonstrates what is possible with Rust.
We can then leverage the positive experiences of creating apps atop Robius to evangelize for the usage of Rust in the app dev world, especially in business scenarios.</p>
<p>Our objective is to show that businesses stand to gain the following benefits from switching to Robius, many of which correspond to <a href="whitepaper/./motivation/business_cases.html">the motivating factors</a> behind the Robius vision itself.</p>
<ul>
<li>Usage of a modern framework and highly-desired language tends to attract top developers and improve team culture and morale.</li>
<li>A multi-platform framework reduces headcount overhead, as developers only need to know Rust and the framework, not the intimate details of each platform.</li>
<li>Customers get to enjoy a more consistent UI and UX across disparate platforms.</li>
<li>Maintainability is easier, enabling more rapid and consistent bug fixes at lower cost, which also leads to higher customer satisfaction and engagement.</li>
<li>Smooth integration with the rest of Rust's huge ecosystem of crates allows developers to lean on the significant shoulders of open-source projects, especially beyond UI elements.</li>
<li>An open-source, distributed, and decentralized project structure gives business leaders confidence about the staying power and independent directions of the framework.</li>
<li>Last but not least, developers get to use Rust!</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="technical-requirements"><a class="header" href="#technical-requirements">Technical Requirements</a></h1>
<p>This section expands on the requirements inherent to the success of the Robius vision and our initial strategies for how to meet them.
These requirements can also be seen as additional project goals, but more technical in nature than those in the previous chapter.</p>
<p>As shown in the following Venn diagram, we have split the set of target requirements into two broad categories: those related to runtime, and those related to build time or developer tooling.
Certain requirements touch on both runtime and build-time system aspects.
The following sections discuss each requirement in more detail.</p>
