# Motivation: why Robius?

Several motivating factors inspired us to start the Robius project:

1. App developers want to use Rust, but aren’t sure where or how to get started due to Rust's app dev ecosystem being in a rough state. 
    * Paralysis of choice among dozens of partial solutions
    * Unclear how to integrate many disparate projects
<p> </p>

2. There are clear **business advantages** to writing applications in a multi-platform Rust framework.
    * Provide a consistent experience for devs and customers
    * Avoid redundant dev effort → save money, faster time to market
<p> </p>

3. Rust is a great language and the right choice for many programming domains, but not for multi-platform apps ... *yet*.
    * Safety → increased correctness, reliability, lower debugging costs
    * High performance → responsive, jank-free UI
    * No runtime or garbage collection → energy efficiency on mobile devices
<p> </p>

The following sections examine each of these factors in detail.
