# Current status
Robius is a brand new vision -- we're just getting off the ground.

Currently, the best way to get started is to directly use one of the [recommended UI toolkits](#key-community-members) to build out your application's UI and define its UX behavior.
For now, everything else beyond UI will require you to add the missing pieces yourself, e.g., network connectivity, async multitasking, and access to other device peripherals or system services. 

Everything is developed right here in the open, so check back for updates often!
We plan to introduce a pre-alpha version of the full Robius system stack (everything beneath the application) by early-to-mid 2024, which will enable easier access to and integration of other platform/OS features alongside the UI toolkits.


## Platform support

Coming soon: a table of which app dev features are supported on which platforms.
